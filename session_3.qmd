# Session 3: Plotting with ggplot2 {#sec-session03}

In this session we will learn how to create and customise plots using the `ggplot2` package.

::: {.callout-tip title="Learning Objectives"}
At the end of this session, learners should be able to:

1.  Create a ggplot and save it for use outside of R
2.  Describe some of the common ways we can change the appearance of a plot, such as themes, legends and colours.
3.  List some of the common geoms available in ggplot2 and what types of data they might be useful for
4.  Use the `facet_wrap` function to create a series of similar plots
5.  Understand how to use the `patchwork` package to compose multiple plots together into a single figure
:::

To get started, let's load the `tidyverse` package, which includes `ggplot2`:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

And read in the `mousezempic_dosage_data` that we have been using in previous sessions:

```{r}
mousezempic_dosage_data <- read_csv("data/mousezempic_dosage_data.csv")
```

## Building our first plot, layer by layer

Although R has a built-in plotting system, `ggplot2` is a more powerful and flexible package for creating plots. The `gg` in `ggplot2` stands for "Grammar of Graphics", which is a way thinking about how each component of a plot (e.g. axes or colours) is part of the 'language' of data visualisation that allows you to compose complex plots piece by piece, just like you combine words to form sentences.

### Initialisation

When making a ggplot, the first thing you need to do is initialise it with the `ggplot()` function. This function takes two arguments:

-   the **data** that you want to visualise (a dataframe/tibble), and
-   **mapping**, which describes the scales that will be used to display the data (e.g. which variable should be the x axis, which should be represented by colour, etc.)

The mapping is specified using the `aes()` function, which stands for 'aesthetics'. It takes named arguments, where the names are the aesthetics you want to use to show your data (e.g. `x`, `y`, `colour`, `shape`, etc.) and the values are the names of the columns in your data that you want to use for those aesthetics.

For example, to make a plot to explore the relationship between the initial weight of the mice and their tail length, we would write:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = initial_weight_g, y = tail_length_mm))
```

In the plot panel (bottom right hand corner), you should now see a blank plot with the x and y axes labelled with the column names we specified in the `aes()` function. There's no data on it yet, because we haven't told ggplot how to physically represent the data on the x and y scales we have specified.

### Adding data

Data is represented in ggplot using **geoms** (short for 'geometric objects'). A geom is a visual representation of the data in the plot, such as points, lines or bars. They are named `geom_*` where `*` is the type of geom you want to use. We will cover some of the most common geoms later in this session.

Geoms are added to plots layers (which are drawn on top of one another, like layers of a cake) using the `+` operator.

For example, let's add points to the plot that we initialised above using `geom_point()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = initial_weight_g, y = tail_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

This gives us a basic scatterplot of the data, with each point representing the tail length and initial weight of a mouse in our dataset.

Notice how we didn't have to specify the data or mapping again when we added the `geom_point()` layer, because the data and mapping are inherited from the initial `ggplot()` function call. This is a common pattern in ggplot2: you only need to specify the data and mapping once, and it is used by all subsequent layers.

::: {.callout-note title="The plus `+` vs the pipe `%>%`"}
You might have noticed that `+` in ggplot works similarly to the pipe operator `%>%` in the `dplyr` package in that you place it at the end of a line of code, but **`+` is only ever used in the context of plotting.**

Don't mix them up! A handy way to remember is that `+` looks a bit like the axes of a plot, so it's what you should use when plotting.
:::

### Overlaying additional data

Of course, this is a very simple plot. To show more information, we can add additional layers using the `+` operator, or use additional aesthetics.

For example, let's add a a layer containing a linear trendline using `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = initial_weight_g, y = tail_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Here, we supplied the `method = "lm"` argument to `geom_smooth()` to tell it fit a linear model (lm for short) to the data and plot the line of best fit, surrounded by a 95% confidence interval. Most geoms will have additional arguments like this that you can use to customise their appearance. Remember that we can check the documentation for geoms and other functions using `?geom_smooth`.

::: {.callout-note title="ggplot and missing values"}
You might have noticed that, along with the plot, R is also printing a warning message that lets us know that some rows of our data contain missing values. ggplot2 will automatically remove these rows from the plot (and warn you that it's happening), but it's always a good idea to check your data for missing values before plotting it, as they can affect the results of your analysis. Recall from last session that we can do this by combining the `is.na()` function with `filter()`:

```{r}
# find the rows of our data that contain missing values in the columns we're plotting
mousezempic_dosage_data %>%
  filter(is.na(initial_weight_g), is.na(tail_length_mm))
```

:::

We can also add additional aesthetics to the plot beyond just `x` and `y`. For example, let's use the `colour` aesthetic to represent the strain of each mouse. To do this, we add `colour = strain` to the `aes()` function that describes the mapping in the `ggplot()` call:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data,
  aes(x = initial_weight_g, y = tail_length_mm, colour = mouse_strain)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Not only are the points now coloured by the strain of each mouse, but there are now three separate colour-coded trendlines, one for each strain. This is because the aesthetic mapping we supply to the `ggplot()` function when initialising the plot is inherited by **all** subsequent layers/geoms.

Notice as well how adding colour to the plot totally changes the way we perceive the data! Without colour and just plotting a single trendline, it appeared that there was an overall negative association between initial weight and tail length, but we can now see that there is actually a positive association within each strain. This is an example of [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox), and shows why it's so important to visualise your data!

### Saving plots as images

Once you've created a plot you're happy with, you'll probably want to save it to use in a paper or presentation. You can do this programmatically using the `ggsave()` function.

To use `ggsave()`, you need to specify:

-   the filename you want to save the plot as (e.g. `"my_plot.png"`),
-   the plot object you want to save (by default, this is the last plot you created, but you can specify a plot that's been assigned to a variable),
-   the file type you want to save the plot as (e.g. `device = "png"`), and
-   the dimensions of the plot (e.g. `width = 6, height = 4`). Dimensions are in inches by default, but you can specify them in other units if you prefer by using the units argument (e.g. `units = "cm"`)

For example, to save the last plot we created as a .png file with dimensions of 5 by 7 inches, we would write:

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggsave("coloured_scatterplot.png", device = "png", width = 5, height = 7)
```

Or to save it as a .pdf file with dimensions of 20 by 30 cm:

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggsave("coloured_scatterplot.pdf", device = "pdf", width = 20, height = 30, units = "cm")
```

Generally, it's good practice to assign the plot you want to save to a variable, and provide that variable to the 'plot' argument of `ggsave()`, rather than relying on the last plot you created. This makes it more clear what plot you're saving, so that your code is more readable and reproducible.

```{r}
# first assign the plot to a variable
colourful_scatterplot <- ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data,
  aes(x = initial_weight_g, y = tail_length_mm, colour = mouse_strain)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# then save the plot: notice the 'plot' argument
ggsave("coloured_scatterplot.pdf", plot = colourful_scatterplot, device = "pdf", width = 20, height = 30, units = "cm")
```

It's also possible to save plots using the export button in the plot panel: ![You can use the export button to save plots interactively](images/S03F01_export.png)

You can choose to save the plot either as an image: ![Saving an R plot as an image](images/S03F02_export_image.png)

In this case, you can set the file type and dimensions, and see a preview of the plot before saving it. Tip: it's also possible to change the dimensions of the plot by dragging the bottom left of the preview window.

You can also save plots as a PDF: ![Saving an R plot as a PDF](images/S03F03_export_pdf.png)

Although there is no preview for PDFs within RStudio itself, you can click the 'preview' button to open the PDF in your default PDF viewer.

In general, it's preferable to save plots programmatically using `ggsave()` because it's more reproducible (because if you ever change your plotting code or data, new plot files can be automatically generated), but the export button can be useful for quickly saving plots during exploratory data analysis (or use the ultimate lazy hack: just screenshot the plot panel!).

<summary>Solutions</summary>

1.  Mapping in ggplot refers to the scales that will be used to display the data (e.g. x, y, colour), not the type of plot you want to create. It is specified using the `aes()` function, and when specified in the initial `ggplot()` function call, is inherited by all subsequent layers/geoms.
2.  The correct way to create a scatterplot of the drug dosage and weight loss in the `mousezempic_dosage_data` dataset is `ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = drug_dosage, y = weight_loss)) + geom_point()`. This specifies the data and mapping in the `ggplot()` function call, and adds a layer of points to the plot using `geom_point()`. The `%>%` operator is not used in ggplot2, and the `x` and `y` mapping should be specified within the `aes()` function. Also, remember that although ggplot2 is the name of the package, the function you use to initialise a plot is `ggplot()`.
3.  To programmatically save the plot created in question 2 as a .pdf file with dimensions of 10 by 15 cm, you would use the `ggsave()` function with the arguments `ggsave("drug_dosage_vs_weight_loss.pdf", device = "pdf", width = 10, height = 15, units = "cm")`. This specifies the filename, file type, dimensions, and units of the plot you want to save. Remember that by default, dimensions are in inches (boooo), so you need to specify the units as "cm" to save the plot with dimensions in centimetres.

## Some commonly used geoms

ggplot2 has (as of writing) almost 50 different geoms that you can use to represent your data. You can see the full list in the [ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#geoms), but some of the most commonly used geoms include:

-   `geom_point()`
-   `geom_line()`
-   `geom_boxplot()`
-   `geom_col()`
-   `geom_violin()`
-   `geom_h/vline()`

In this section, we will briefly cover these geoms and how you might use them to visualise your data. It's not designed to be an exhaustive list, but hopefully it will help you get started with some of the most common types of plots you might want to create.

::: {.callout-note title="How do I make a ... plot in ggplot2?"}
Often, you might come across a specific type of plot you want to make that is a bit more complex than the basic geoms we've covered here. If you know the name of the plot you're wanting to make, you can often find a tutorial/guide online by googling, or you could ask an AI assistant like ChatGPT. Particularly for specific types of data (e.g. clinical data, phylogenetic data), there are often field-specific packages that provide geoms or functions to make particular types of plots, like the [ggtree package](https://yulab-smu.top/treedata-book/index.html) for phylogenetic trees or the [survminer package](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/survminer/) for survival plots.

If the plot doesn't have a specifc name, you can try to break it down by thinking about the geoms you might need to use to represent the data, or try uploading a picture of a similar plot to ChatGPT.

Whatever method you use, remember to add 'ggplot2' to your search query to get the most relevant results, as there are many different plotting packages in R!

### geom_point

Above, we saw how to use `geom_point()` to create a scatterplot, but `geom_point()` can be used in other ways too. For example, you can use it to create a dot plot, where the x axis is categorical and the y axis is continuous:

```{r}
# make a dot plot of initial weight by mouse strain
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = mouse_strain, y = initial_weight_g)) +
  geom_point()
```

Notice how the points are stacked on top of one another for each strain. This is because the x axis is categorical, and ggplot2 doesn't know how to spread the points out. This can make it difficult to see the individual points, so when making a plot like this it's often useful to add the  `position = position_jitter()` argument to `geom_point()`:

```{r}
# make a jittered dot plot of initial weight by mouse strain
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = mouse_strain, y = initial_weight_g)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter())
```
The `position_jitter()` function adds a small amount of random noise to the x axis position of each point, which helps to spread them out and make it easier to see the individual points. Like most functions in ggplot2, `position_jitter()` will try to guess an appropriate amount of jitter to add, but you can specify the amount as well:

```{r}
# use less jitter so there is more distinction between the different mouse strains
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = mouse_strain, y = initial_weight_g)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2))
```
The exact amount of jitter you need will depend heavily on your data, so it's often a good idea to experiment with different amounts to see what works best.

::: {.callout-note title="Beeswarm plots"}
Another way to spread out points in a dot plot is to use a beeswarm plot, in which points are spread out slightly along the x axis so that they don't overlap. The `ggbeeswarm` package provides a `geom_beeswarm()` function that you can use to create beeswarm plots in ggplot2 (rather than using `geom_point(position = position_jitter())` like we did here). For more information, see the [ggbeeswarm documentation](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm/blob/main/README.md).
:::

### geom_line
As the name suggests, `geom_line()` is used to create line plots. These are useful for showing trends over time or across a continuous variable. Since we don't have a time variable in our dataset, let's use the `drug_dosage` variable to show how weight loss changes with increasing dosage:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = drug_dose_g, y = weight_lost_g)) +
  geom_line()
```
(In reality the relationship between these variables is probably better represented as points on a scatterplot rather than as a line, but this is just an example of how you can use `geom_line()`).

It's also possible to combine `geom_line()` with `geom_point()` to show the individual data points as well as the connection between them:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = drug_dose_g, y = weight_lost_g)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

### geom_hline / geom_vline
The `geom_hline()` and `geom_vline()` functions are used to add horizontal and vertical lines to a plot, respectively. Although simple, they are often useful for highlighting specific values or thresholds in your data. To use them, you need to specify the `yintercept` (for `geom_hline()`) or `xintercept` (for `geom_vline()`) argument, which specifies where to draw the line.

For example, let's add a horizontal line to our scatterplot of drug dosage and weight loss at the 4g mark, which might represent a clinically significant amount of weight loss:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = drug_dose_g, y = weight_lost_g)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 4)
```

We could also add a vertical line at the 0.0025g mark to show the theorectical maximum dosage of the drug:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = drug_dose_g, y = weight_lost_g)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 4) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.0025)
```
Notice how adding this line extends the x axis to include 0.0025, even though there are no data points at that value. This is because, by default, ggplot2 chooses axes limits for you that include all the data and any additional layers you add to the plot.

### geom_boxplot
Boxplots are a useful way to visualise the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories, allowing you to easily see the median, quartiles, and any outliers in the data. To create a boxplot in ggplot2, you can use the `geom_boxplot()` function.

For example, let's create a boxplot of the initial weight of the mice by strain:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = mouse_strain, y = initial_weight_g)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

It's often useful to add points to a boxplot to show the individual data points as well as the summary statistics. You can do this by adding a `geom_point()` layer to the plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mousezempic_dosage_data, aes(x = mouse_strain, y = initial_weight_g)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2))
```
