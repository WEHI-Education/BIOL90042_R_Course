The R coding language enables user-friendly data tidying and transformation, and creation of publication-ready graphics. R is also core to bioinformatics research, supporting all types of ’omics data analysis, and general statistical analysis too.  \n\nDesigned for complete coding beginners, this course will introduce data wrangling, data visualisation, and bioinformatics analysis in R. The first 4 of 6 sessions will cover foundations of R, and user-friendly ‘tidyverse’ software, which is applicable to many areas of medical and clinical research, and beyond. The final two sessions will combine tidyverse and specialised bioinformatics software to perform an RNA seq analysis workflow. \n\n## How to use this book\nThis course is divided into 6 sessions. In the first 3 sessions, we will cover the basics of R and the tidyverse, and in the last 3 sessions, we will apply these skills to a bioinformatics analysis (session 4 covers a more general analysis, while 5 & 6 focus on RNA-seq). Each session is divided into sections, which are designed to be completed in order. Each section contains a mix of text, code, and exercises.\n\nCode is shown in blue, with the output below it in grey, just like it would show up in the R console.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This is an R code block\n# You can run this code by copying it into the R console\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can run the code yourself by copying it (using the copy button in the top right of the code block) and pasting it into R on your computer.",
