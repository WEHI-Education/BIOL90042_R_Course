# Session 4: Putting it all together

In this session we will combine all the skills we have learned so far to perform a complete analysis of a (small) dataset

## Learning objectives

At the end of this session, learners should be able to:

1.  Describe the key steps in data analysis (exploration, manipulating and plotting)
2.

## Introduction to the dataset

describe the fake experiment setup and the data files you will start with

## Exploring the data

in this step we get familiar with the dataset and think about what sorts of plots we can make/things we can look at

## Manipulating the data

in this step we will use dplyr to get the data frame into a form that will allow us to answer the questions we came up with above

## Visualising the data

finally we will make some nice visualisations

if time, i think it would be nice to include (briefly) tables with the gt() package.
